## Design Goals

In terms of what to change about the game, the mod has several goals, and attempts to strike a balance between them. However, certain things are prioritized. The goals are listed below in order of importance:

1) to reward skillful play (in the context of speedrunning and racing)
2) to make the game more fun to play
3) to fix bugs and imperfections
4) to keep the game as "vanilla" as possible

<br />

## List of Main Changes

### 1) Character Changes

* All characters now start with the D6. (Much of the strategy in the game is centered around having this item and it heavily mitigates run disparity.)
* Certain characters have their starting health changed so that they can consistently take a devil deal:
  * Judas starts with half a red heart and half a soul heart.
  * Blue Baby starts with an extra half soul heart.
  * Azazel starts with an extra half soul heart.
* Judas starts with a bomb instead of 3 coins.
* Samson no longer starts with the Child's Heart. (This is a quality of life change, since the Child's Heart is usually immediately dropped.)
* Eden starts with the Schoolbag. They will start with their random active item inside the bag. (This is to preserve the active item.)

### 2) No Curses

All curses are automatically disabled.

### 3) Devil Room & Angel Room Rebalancing

Since Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms are the most skill-based component of the game, their rewards have been [slightly rebalanced](https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-racing-client/blob/master/mod/CHANGES-ROOM.md#devil-room-rebalancing).

### 4) Wrath of the Lamb Style Room Clear

Rooms are considered cleared at the beginning of an enemy's death animation, rather than the end. (This was the way the game was originally intended to be, but it was incorrectly ported to Rebirth.)

### 5) Room Fixes

Hundreds of rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted.

### 6) Room Flipping

While there are thousands of rooms in the game, many players have already seen them all. To increase run variety, asymmetrical rooms have a chance to be flipped on the X axis, Y axis, or both axes.

<br />

## Other Mods Included

* [Samael](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=897795840), a custom character created by [Ghostbroster](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostbrosterconnor). He is a melee character that uses his scythe to attack enemies. In Racing+, Samael starts with D6, the Schoolbag, the Wraith Skull, and 1 bomb.

<br />

## List of Minor Changes

### Custom Hotkeys

* Racing+ allows you to bind two new hotkeys via a custom challenge:
  * a drop button that will immediately drop all trinkets and pocket items
  * a dedicated Schoolbag switch button
* Binding these hotkeys is optional. If they are not bound, Racing+ will use the vanilla behavior.

### Gameplay & Quality of Life Changes

* The Polaroid or The Negative will be automatically removed depending on your run goal.
* The trapdoor or the beam of light on Womb 2 will be automatically removed depending on your run goal or which photo you have.
* Some items with no effect are removed:
  * the Karma trinket (all Donation Machines are removed when curses are disabled)
  * the Amnesia pill (this has no effect when curses are disabled)
  * the ??? pill (this has no effect when curses are disabled)
* Some things that are unseeded are now seeded:
  * rerolls on items after being touched or purchased
  * Teleport!, Undefined, Cursed Eye, Broken Remote, and Telepills teleports
  * Dead Sea Scrolls item selection
  * cards from Sloth, Super Sloth, Pride, and Super Pride
* Void Portals are automatically deleted.
* The restart key immediately restarts the game. (To perform a fast-restart on the second floor and beyond, you need to double tap R.)
* [Special items](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Special_Item) are no longer special.
* Items that drop pickups on the ground will now automatically insert them into your inventory instead, if there is room. (However, Purple Heart, Mom's Toenail, The Tick, Faded Polaroid, and Ouroboros Worm are never inserted automatically.) This effect also applies to the Spun! transformation.
* You will always be able to take an item in the Basement 1 Treasure Room without spending a bomb or being forced to walk on spikes.
* Troll Bombs and Mega Troll Bombs always have a fuse timer of exactly 2 seconds.
* Identified pills (up to 7) will be shown when the player presses Tab.
* Diagonal knife throws have a 3-frame window instead of a 1-frame window.
* Duplicate rooms will no longer appear on the same run. (Basement 1 is exempt.)
* The Boss Rush is modified to include the Afterbirth+ bosses and Chapter 4 bosses.

* The pickup delay on reloaded pedestal items is decreased from 18 frames to 15 frames.
* Having Duality will now always give you both the Devil Room and the Angel Room. (This does not happen consistently on vanilla like you would expect.)
* All Spike Chests will spawn as Mimics instead. (Since they are so similar, there is little reason for Spike Chests to exist.)
* The Chub that spawns after The Matriarch will be automatically stunned for a few frames to prevent unavoidable damage.
* Hosts and Mobile Hosts are now immune to fear. (This prevents bugs where feared Hosts will not properly play animations.)
* The Forsaken is now immune to fear. (This prevents the bug where it will not attack.)
* Blastocyst is now immmune to freeze. (This prevents delays during the death animation.)
* The "Would you like to do a Victory Lap!?" popup no longer appears after defeating The Lamb.
* All pills can now be used to cancel pedestal pickup animations.
* The door to Hush is now automatically opened.
* The devil statue will be faded if there is an item pedestal hiding behind it.

### Cutscene & Animation Removal

* The cutscenes that occur when you launch the game and when you finish a run are removed.
* The cutscenes that occur before each boss are removed.
* Some animations are removed for the purposes of eliminating needless downtime:
  * the fade when entering a new floor (replaced with a custom animation)
  * the fade when entering or exiting crawlspaces (replaced with a normal room transition animation)
  * all "giantbook" animations (with the exception of Book of Revelations, Satanic Bible, eternal hearts, and black hearts)

### Graphics & Sound Fixes

* The Abaddon collectible is replaced with the pre-Booster Pack 5 version.
* The 20/20 collectible is now easier to see.

* The red spotted pill sprite has been changed to an all-red sprite so that it is easier to distinguish from other red pills.
* Pill sprites now have consistent orientations. (Thanks goes to [Nioffe](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nioffe) for creating the sprites in the [Consistent Pills](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1418510121) mod.)

* The door opening sound will no longer play in crawlspaces.
